                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    After graduation, I hope to go to college to Aerospace Engineering and Computer Science as a dual major. My top choice schools are Georgia Tech and University of Pennsylvania; and more realistically; Purdue University and Texas A&M. I am applying mostly to decent schools that have a good double major program so there aren't issues with my plan.
